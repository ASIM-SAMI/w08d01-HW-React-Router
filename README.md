### You have a React App ready, all you need to do is install the required libraries:

Let's get some more practice with routing in React. There is a large javascript
array for which you to work with located in [gameOfThrones.js](gameOfThrones.js).

The goal of the homework is to display this data with the following routes:

- `/families` -  show all family names as links to view that family.
- `/families/:id` - show a single family's data with links to view individual
  members of that family.
- `/families/new` - create a new family.
- `/families/:family_id/members/:id` -  show a single family member's data.
- `/families/:family_id/members/new` - create a new member for a family.
